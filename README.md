# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

### This project comprises of a comparative study of different ML Algorithms used on the same dataset for Fraud Detection
The algorithms used are:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Classifier

These algorithms have been compared on basis of different performance metrics like Accuracy Score, Precision Score, F1 score and Recall Score.
